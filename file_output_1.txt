In light of the various incidents of abuse of school going children on the way to
and back from schools, it has become necessary that all possible steps are taken to
ensure safety of school children in their journey to and from the school.
An important step in this regard would be to have police verification carried out
in respect of the drivers and helpers etc. of bus/van/auto-rickshaw ferrying school
children.
lt is instructed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, New Delhi, that
the staff may be engaged for ferrying school children only after police verification of
their character and antecedents is completed. Moreover, with the passage of time, a
person may be affected by many psycho-social factors in his immediate or distant
environment. It would therefore be desirable that the police verification is repeated
after every two years, so as to ensure continued safety of the children in their journey
to and from the school.
It is therefore enjoined upon all the Heads of the 
Govt./Govt. aided/
Primary/Secondary/Higher secondary & Special Schools in the State of Goa to strictly
adhere to the above instructions and stringent action will be taken against the school
authorities in case of any violation/lapse with regard to the safety and well being of
school children.

Mandate / Guidelines of Monitoring to be followed by the Regional
Sub:
Offices of the Ministry of Environment and Forests — Instructions —
Regarding.
Some instances have been brought to the notice of the Ministry of Environment &
Forests where Scientists or Officials of the Regional Offices of this Ministry have been directly
interacting with various other Statutory and Regulatory Authorities on behalf of the project
proponents on matters concerning the EIA Notification, 2006; such as exemption from public
hearing, approval for change of technologies etc.
2.
It may be noted that the Regional Offices are to monitor the implementation of the
stipulated conditions and environmental safeguards contained in the Environmental Clearance
letters, obviously after the project has been granted environmental clearance.  Sometimes the
Regional Offices are formally requested by the Ministry to provide any specific information as
may be requisite for appraisal of any particular project.
In view of the above role, it has, therefore, been reiterated that the Regional Offices
3.
should not take up issues of any project proponent with various Statutory Authorities directly.
Such cases should be invariably referred to the Ministry for advice and guidance, henceforth.
This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority.
