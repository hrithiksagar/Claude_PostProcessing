No. Acad/Misc/MHRD/2017/2100 C U L A R In light of the various incidents of abuse of school going children on the way to and back from schools, it has become necessary that all possible steps are taken to ensure safety of school children in their journey to and from the school. An important step in this regard would be to have police verification carried out in respect of the drivers and helpers etc. of bus/van/auto-rickshaw ferrying school children. lt is instructed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, New Delhi, that the staff may be engaged for ferrying school children only after police verification of their character and antecedents is completed. Moreover, with the passage of time, a person may be affected by many psycho-social factors in his immediate or distant environment. It would therefore be desirable that the police verification is repeated after every two years, so as to ensure continued safety of the children in their journey to and from the school. It is therefore enjoined upon all the Heads of the  Govt./Govt. aided/ Primary/Secondary/Higher secondary & Special Schools in the State of Goa to strictly adhere to the above instructions and stringent action will be taken against the school authorities in case of any violation/lapse with regard to the safety and well being of school children.
